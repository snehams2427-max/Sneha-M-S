# Subscription-Based Access Pass

## 📌 Project Description
The **Subscription-Based Access Pass** is a smart-contract-powered subscription system designed to restrict or grant access to services based on active subscription status. It allows users to purchase time-based access using cryptocurrency, simplifying decentralized membership management.
